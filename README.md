## My process

Used ATOM software as my primary HTML coder.

First, created a simple .html and .css files to stablish my code.

Added Style to BODY, to recrete the same color from th result of the challenge.

Created a single Div, to create a Card-like style to the QR code image.

Added margins to DIV and curved it's edges.

Separated image and 2 paragraphs and added them their own styles.

Centered image using padding and margin.

Centered Paragraphs with padding.

Added Fonts from Google fonts


### Built with

- ATOM


### What I learned

Learned on how to distinguish parent and child boxes. This is really important to understand, in order to modify images or text in a way to one's vision.

### Continued development

I recently started to code in HTML and CSS (In the future Bootstrap and Javascript) to become a full stack web developer.

I will update my future works here in github and as well this document
